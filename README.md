This program was created for the Flatiron Community as a Ruby on Rails Project.

The purpose of the program is to allow a user to create hotels, rooms, and tenants. It also allows the user to manipulate these options and assign reservations to tenants for specific dates and party members.

To use this program, simply clone down the repository from github using 'git clone' after copying the SSH link.

Then run bundle install to prepare the gems needed to run the program.

Lastly, navigate to localhost:3000 to get started!
